# Yaesu FT-1D Files

## Overview

This folder contains Programming files for the Yaesu FT-1D

Release: MDDATEFLD

The files were prepared using the Yaesu ADMS6 FT-1D software with Data extracted from the WIA data set.

## Files
* Configuration

> I dont have ready access to this radio to develop configuration files 

* Build Files to create standard configuration

    - vkrepft-1dradms6.csv - Output from the repeater configuration

## Notes

    I have created an extract file that should work ok with the ADMS6 software, If you have RT-Systems then the data file from the FT-2DR might be more appropriate.
