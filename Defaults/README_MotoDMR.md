# Motorola DMR Files

## Overview

This folder contains Programming files for the Motorola DMR radios

Release: MDDATEFLD

The files were prepared using the MotoTrbo CPS 12.1 and the CPS utilities software with Data extracted from the WIA data set.

## Files
* Configuration
    - Not Yet - most recent MD 380 file, YOU MUST change your radio id.


* Build Files to create standard configuration

    - motocontacts.csv - Output from the marc database for motocontacts

## Notes

    Still very early days here
    
    Radio Buttons 
        Not set yet
        

    This is a fairly automated build so once you get the file you should change a few things.
     * Your ID and similar fields in General Settings.
     
     You probably want to move some other channels into the VK2RCG zone (e.g. ROT,ROZ, RCG FM).
     
     The tools I am using:-
        - Motorola CPS
        - motocontact from kd8eyf
