## General unix and Linux (OSX)
 The scripts here are using bash, awk, sed, sort, perl (and probably some other bits) I will try and migrate most to perl

## Install some perl modules 
Ham::Locator
Geo::Direction::Distance
Text::CSV_XS
XML::LibXML


and some other bits

* I just run and have a quick look at errors until things are fixed up
